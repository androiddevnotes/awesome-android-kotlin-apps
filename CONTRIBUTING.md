# Contributing Guide

## How to contribute

- Fork the project from the `master` branch and submit a Pull Request (PR)

  - Explain what the PR fixes or improves.

- If you aim to add a new app to list, specify the tech stack and explain why is it worth to include via [raising an issue here](https://github.com/androiddevnotes/awesome-android-kotlin-apps/issues/new?title=Add%20New%20Repo&body=**Repo%20UR**:%20REPO_URL_GOES_HERE%20**Tech%20Stack**:%20TECH_STACK_GOES_HERE&label=new-repo)
  
  
- Use sensible commit messages

  - If your PR fixes a separate issue number, include it in the commit message.



- Use a sensible number of commit messages as well

  - e.g. Your PR should not have 1000s of commits.
